# 📰 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

This project uses **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** and **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** models to detect fake news articles. Built using Python in **Jupyter Notebook**, the model classifies news articles as either **real** or **fake** based on their content. 

The main goal is to combat the spread of misinformation using modern AI techniques.
